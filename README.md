# sysread
 Library for the parsing of SPSS System files.
 In theory, this library should be cross-platform in terms of OS,
 but may not function as intended if compiled for non x86-64 chipsets.

 ## build
 Navigate to bin/ and run the make command (for unix-like systems only).  Not sure how to build on windows, frankly, so if that's you: good luck.

 ## dependencies
 libc
